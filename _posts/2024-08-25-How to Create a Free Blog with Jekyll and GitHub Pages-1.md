Your Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Free Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

Have you ever wanted to start your own blog without the cost and complexity of traditional hosting platforms? You're in the right place. This guide will walk you through the entire process of creating a fast, secure, and completely free blog using **Jekyll**, a powerful static site generator, and **GitHub Pages** for hosting.

This post will cover everything from initial setup on macOS, Windows, and Linux to deploying your site and troubleshooting common issues.

## Step 1: Getting Your System Ready

Before we can start building, we need to install a few essential tools. Jekyll is built with a programming language called **Ruby**, so the first step is to get a modern version of Ruby running on your computer.

### For macOS Users

Setting up on a Mac is smooth with the help of **Homebrew**, a package manager for macOS.

**Install Homebrew:**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


Install Ruby:

brew install ruby


Configure Your Terminal's PATH:

echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix ruby)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin:$PATH"' | sudo tee -a ~/.zshrc


Reload Your Terminal:

source ~/.zshrc


Install Jekyll and Bundler:

gem install bundler jekyll

For Windows Users

The easiest way to get started on Windows is with the RubyInstaller.

Install Ruby+Devkit:
Download and run the RubyInstaller. Choose a Ruby+Devkit version and ensure the “Add Ruby executables to your PATH” box is checked.

Install Jekyll and Bundler:

gem install jekyll bundler

Step 2: Creating Your First Jekyll Blog

With the tools installed, it's time for the fun part.

Create a New Site:

jekyll new my-awesome-blog


Preview Your Blog Locally:

cd my-awesome-blog
bundle exec jekyll serve


Now, open a web browser and go to: http://localhost:4000

Step 3: Pushing Your Blog to GitHub

Let's connect your local blog to your new GitHub repository.

Initialize Git:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git


Add, Commit, and Push Your Files:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main


After a few minutes, your blog will be live at:
👉 https://your-username.github.io

GitHub Push Troubleshooting

Even with the correct setup, you may face some issues while pushing code to GitHub. Here are common errors and fixes.

❌ Error: src refspec main does not match any

This means you haven't made any commits yet. Run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

❌ Error: Password authentication is not supported

GitHub no longer accepts passwords for command-line operations. You must use a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Generate a Token:

On GitHub, go to:
Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)

Click Generate new token, give it a name, set an expiration, and check the repo scope.

Copy the token and use it when the terminal asks for your password.
